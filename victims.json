Britton was studying anthropology at Harvard, and her father was at the time a vice president at Radcliffe College, a women's school in Cambridge that later merged with Harvard. Her body was found on her blood-stained mattress by her boyfriend who went to check on her when she didn't show up for a test that morning. The night before her body was found, she had gone to dinner with classmates and went ice skating with her boyfriend in Cambridge. Toxicology testing revealed that the alcohol she drank that evening didn't have time to metabolize in her bloodstream before she died, suggesting she was killed shortly after returning to her apartment.The perpetrator turned out to be a serial rapist and killer named Michael Sumpter, who died in 2001. Sumpter has since been linked to the murders of two other women he didn\u2019t know. Neighbors told police they heard someone on the fire escape that connected to Britton's fourth-floor apartment on the night she was killed. It is believed Sumpter entered her apartment through a window.Sumter had ties to Cambridge and had lived there as a young child. In 1967, less than two years before Britton's murder, he was working on Arrow Street in Cambridge, about a mile from Britton's apartment.","perpetrator_id":1},{"id":2,"first_name":"Ellen","middle_name":"Faith","last_name":"Rutchick","date_of_birth":{"date":"1948-04-05 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"gender":"F","cause_of_death":"Strangulation","incident_date":{"date":"1972-01-05 00:00:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"location":"42\u00b021'02.7\"N 71\u00b005'21.1\"W","description":"Ellen Rutchick worked at the Colonnade Hotel in Boston's Back Bay, where she did event planning.
